          <h2>Privacy Policy & Terms</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="privacy-container-content">
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is
            collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from
            www.uselikeagirl.com (the “Site”).
          </p>

          <p>
            PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT When you visit the Site, we
            automatically collect certain information about your device,
            including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone,
            and some of the cookies that are installed on your device.
            Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about
            the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or
            search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you
            interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected
            information as “Device Information.” We collect Device Information
            using the following technologies: - “Log files” track actions
            occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address,
            browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and
            date/time stamps. - “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are
            electronic files used to record information about how you browse the
            Site. Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a
            purchase through the Site, we collect certain information from you,
            including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment
            information (including credit card numbers), email address, and
            phone number. We refer to this information as “Order Information.”
            When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we
            are talking both about Device Information and Order Information.
          </p>

          <p>
            HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION? We use the Order
            Information that we collect generally to fulfill any orders placed
            through the Site (including processing your payment information,
            arranging for shipping, and providing you with invoices and/or order
            confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order Information to:
            Communicate with you; Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud;
            and When in line with the preferences you have shared with us,
            provide you with information or advertising relating to our products
            or services. We use the Device Information that we collect to help
            us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP
            address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for
            example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and
            interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing
            and advertising campaigns).
          </p>
          <p>
            SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION We share your Personal Information
            with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as
            described above. For example, we use Shopify to power our online
            store--you can read more about how Shopify uses your Personal
            Information here: https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy. We also use
            Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the
            Site--you can read more about how Google uses your Personal
            Information here: https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.
            You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here:
            https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. Finally, we may also share
            your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and
            regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other
